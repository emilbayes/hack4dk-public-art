Ideas
-----

- Quality of Art - A heuristic for the quality of art is art that has transitioned
                   into public museums. If it's in a museum it is probably part
                   of the national collection, and of higher quality.
- Distribution of features over time
  - Male vs Female Artists
  - Age of Artist at the time the piece is added to the collection
  - Geolocation (Catival vs. province)

      <h1>Gender Distribution in Public Art</h1>
      <p>
        The graphic below shows the distribution of public art in Denmark, as
        bought by <a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statens_Kunstfond">Statens Kunstfond</a>.
        The teal area is male artists, the redorange area is female artists. The x-axis shows
        the creation year of the piece, with some uncertainty. The dark curve shows
        the difference between male and female artists, meaning a curvature around
        zero would mean a "fair" distribution. Each of the vertical, white lines
        show when a new committee have started their period.
